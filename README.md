# vhost-device

## Design

This repository hosts various 'vhost-user' device backends in their own crates.
See their individual README.md files for specific information about those
crates.

Here is the list of device backends that we support:

- [I2C](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vhost-device/blob/master/src/i2c/README.md)
- [RNG](https://github.com/rust-vmm/vhost-device/blob/master/src/rng/README.md)
