# In vhost-device-vsock we use the `config` crate which now has the `yaml-rust`
# dependency that is unmaintained as cargo audit is reporting.
# See https://github.com/rust-vmm/vhost-device/issues/639
#
# They merged the fix, but for now they don't do a release because they don't
# have a maintainer. To get the CI green, let's do this workaround, but before
# the next release we have to find a solution.
